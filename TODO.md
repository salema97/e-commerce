# E-commerce Monorepo — Implementation Plan

## Decisions Log (defaults assumed)

- **Auth**: Native JWT (email/password, access + refresh tokens). Clerk is not used at runtime.
- **Admin panel**: inside the web app under `/admin`.
- **Mobile**: Expo development build (required for Stripe/push notifications).
- **API style**: REST + OpenAPI, client generated for web/mobile.
- **Checkout**: Stripe Checkout on web, Payment Intents on mobile, webhooks for fulfillment.
- **Search**: Meilisearch indexed from Prisma on product mutations.
- **State**: TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for client-only state.
- **Messaging**: Evolution API as separate service. Provider: Baileys (MVP, free) → WhatsApp Cloud API (scale, official).
- **WhatsApp use cases**: transactional notifications + support inbox in MVP; marketing/bot flows only with Cloud API.
- **SRI integration**: direct integration with SRI SOAP/XML services, signing XML with `.p12` certificate. No intermediary.
- **Versions (latest compatible)**: Node 22.23.0, pnpm 10.34.3, TypeScript 5.9.3, NestJS 11.1.27, Prisma 7.8.0, Next.js 16.2.9, React 19.2.7, Expo SDK 56.0.12, React Native 0.85.3, Tailwind 4.3.1, shadcn 4.11.0, Zod 4.4.3.
- **Language / market**: Spanish-only UI; Ecuador-only market at launch.
- **Team experience**: assumes TypeScript/React familiarity; moderate learning curve for NestJS/Next.js specifics.

## SDD Phase Mapping

SDD (Spec-Driven Development) is used for phases with high business risk, legal/compliance exposure, complex integrations, or many moving parts. Phases marked **SDD** require a written spec/proposal before implementation.

| Phase | SDD required | Reason |
|-------|:------------:|--------|
| Phase 0 — Monorepo Setup | ❌ | Mechanical setup; checklist is enough. |
| Phase 1 — API Core | ⚠️ Partial | SDD for RBAC/auth, `PaymentProvider`, and `InvoiceProvider` abstractions only. |
| Phase 2 — Shared Packages | ❌ | Small libraries with clear contracts. |
| Phase 3 — Web App | ❌ | Standard UI/CRUD; iterate quickly. |

## Launch Blockers

| Item | Why it blocks |
|------|---------------|
| PCI DSS scope reduction | Card data must never touch your servers; use Stripe tokenization. |
| Stripe webhook signature verification | Missing verification lets attackers fake payment events. |
| JWT validation in API + Server Actions | Prevents auth bypass and data leaks. |
| Granular rate limiting on login/register/checkout/webhooks | Prevents credential stuffing, carding, and abuse. |
| Evolution API webhook signature verification | Prevents fake inbound messages. |
| **SRI Ecuador e-invoicing (for Ecuador orders)** | Ecuadorian law requires authorized electronic invoices for every paid order; missing this blocks legal fulfillment. |
| **SRI credentials and certificate** | RUC, `.p12` certificate, SOL key, establishment/emission codes, and authorized sequences are required to issue valid invoices. |
| **Ecuador-local payment methods (conditional)** | If the target market is Ecuador, local bank cards/mobile money/cash networks (Kushki, PayPhone, MercadoPago, PlaceToPay) are required for broad checkout adoption. |
| **Admin audit logging** | Security/compliance requirement to track who changed what and when for mutating admin actions. |
| GDPR / CCPA compliance | Privacy policy, lawful basis, data-subject rights, DPAs. |
| Sales-tax / VAT nexus | Wrong collection can create penalties; consult a tax advisor. |
| Terms / Refund / Return policies | Required for dispute resolution and payment-processor approval. |
| WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility | Reduces ADA litigation risk. |
| HTTPS + security headers everywhere | Basic security baseline. |

## Launch MVP Definition

The minimum set of capabilities required to launch the Ecuador e-commerce operation:

- Catalog and product detail (Phase 3).
- Cart and guest/authenticated checkout (Phases 1, 3, 5).
- Stripe payments with webhook fulfillment (Phase 5).
- SRI electronic invoicing for every paid Ecuador order (Phase 7).
- Basic admin panel: products, categories, orders, invoices (Phases 1, 3, 7).
- Transactional WhatsApp and email notifications (Phases 6, 8).
- Native JWT authentication with role-based admin access (Phases 1, 3).
- Security baseline: HTTPS, JWT validation, webhook signature verification, granular rate limiting (Phases 1 and 16).

Stripe is the MVP payment method. Local Ecuador payment methods (Kushki, PayPhone, MercadoPago, PlaceToPay) should be added before full public launch if the primary target market is Ecuador.

Everything else (AI, advanced analytics, marketplaces, ERP, WMS, loyalty, referrals) is post-launch.
